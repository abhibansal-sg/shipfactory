# ShipFactory — Development Guide

Instructions for AI agents and developers working on the ShipFactory codebase.

ShipFactory is a governed software factory built on Hermes kanban: recipes
(pipelines of agent tasks + review/approval gates), seats (worker roles),
watchdogs, budgets, and cost telemetry. Specs go in; reviewed, approved,
shipped code comes out. **Nothing ships without the operator's signal.**

## The One Law

**Approval gates belong to the human operator. Agents never press Approve —
not via the dashboard, not via the API, not by completing the gate's kanban
task directly.** An agent that needs a gate cleared reports to the operator
and waits. Operator overrides of *non-approval* steps are permitted with a
logged reason (`recipe release` / audited direct SQL with a backup).

## Layout

```

Published recipe versions are **immutable** — `dev-pipeline@4` bytes are
sha-pinned in `tests/test_artifact_discipline.py`. To change a recipe,
publish `@N+1`; never edit a published version in place.

## Running

The package needs the Hermes repo on `PYTHONPATH` (it imports
`hermes_cli.kanban_db`) and file descriptors ≥ 4096:

```bash
cd /Volumes/MainData/Developer/products/shipfactory
ulimit -n 4096
export PYTHONPATH=/Users/abbhinnav/Developer/products/hermes-mobile
PY=/Users/abbhinnav/Developer/products/hermes-mobile/.venv/bin/python

$PY -m shipfactory.cli daemon --board <board>     # the daemon
$PY -m pytest tests/ -q                           # the tests (all must pass)
```

State lives in `$HERMES_HOME/shipfactory/` (`shipfactory.db`, `seats.yaml`,
`runs/`, `telemetry.jsonl`). The kanban boards live in
`$HERMES_HOME/kanban/boards/<board>/kanban.db`.

## Engine invariants

- `advance_events` keys are **permanently spent** — never replay an applied
  event by re-inserting its key; enqueue a fresh event instead. Since A0
  (2026-07-15) events are additionally **leased**: `pending → leased →
  applied|discarded|failed` under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`; an expired lease
  returns to `pending` without reinsertion; stale events are `discarded`
  with a reason, never silently indistinguishable from success.
- **External effects go through the `action_intents` journal** (A0):
  gate completions, collector completions, and notification sends execute
  OUTSIDE factory write transactions. A retry after a crash inserts a
  fresh `(logical_key, attempt+1)` intent and PROBES the target first —
  the kanban task may already be done, the message already sent. Never
  perform an external effect directly inside an event-apply transaction.
- **One daemon per machine** (A0): the daemon holds an exclusive flock on
  `$HERMES_HOME/shipfactory/daemon.lock`; a second daemon exits before
  opening any board. CLI and dashboard commands ENQUEUE only — approve/
  reject/release return a queued decision id and the daemon tick applies
  it. There is no synchronous apply path outside the daemon.
- The advancer is the **single writer** for recipe-step state. Human/API
  decisions are *queued* (`gate_decision`, `operator_release`) and applied
  on the daemon tick — never mutate `recipe_steps` outside it except as an
  audited operator override with a `.bak` of the DB first.
- Approval-gate kanban tasks are born `blocked/needs_input`; the approve
  path must `unblock_task` → `complete_task` and **check the return value**
  (finding #30 — a silently swallowed approve looked like a dead button).
- A review verdict may only target an **upstream** agent_task. A first-step
  review targeting itself is unroutable and will stall (finding #29).
- `_summary()` treats `superseded` rows as non-terminal; stale ones can pin
  an instance at `running` after its real steps finish.
- Recipe instances persist their trusted `base_sha`; required v2 inputs from
  an older base block visibly as `artifact_stale` and need a fresh activation.
- Sealed artifact bytes publish through a same-directory fsynced temp file and
  atomic rename. Validation rejection is terminal; interrupted sealing remains
  retryable and must verify or safely replace any torn deterministic target.

## Operational pitfalls (learned the hard way)

- **Restart the daemon after any board heal / REINDEX / file swap.** Its
  long-lived SQLite connections carry stale WAL state and throw
  `disk I/O error` on spawn until restarted.
- **Never bind-mount `$HERMES_HOME` into Docker/VirtioFS** while boards are
  live — it corrupts SQLite WAL (finding #28, "ghost tasks").
- `store.py` connections must close deterministically (`_ClosingConnection`,
  finding #27) — a leaked fd per call ends in EMFILE mid-run.
- Task specs must reference **real symbols** — workers correctly refuse to
  invent code for functions that don't exist, and the rework loop will spin
  until the spec is fixed.
- Failure limit: after 2 consecutive non-success attempts the dispatcher
  auto-blocks the task. Reset `consecutive_failures` when re-readying.
- `--require-recipes` startup aborts (unreadable config, recipes disabled,
  startup-guard failure) now persist a `daemon_require_recipes_fail_closed`
  telemetry record before raising (finding #31, adversarial lane review
  §2.0.6/#10) — a fail-closed abort must leave a trace, not just a nonzero
  exit code that vanishes with the process.
- Worker ownership is database-first: persist the run and acquire its
  `worker_slot` lease before spawn, then bind PID + OS start token. On restart,
  adopt only an exact token match; a live-looking reused PID is a crashed run.
- Missing executor usage is `NULL`, never zero. Cost rollups expose known and
  unknown run counts separately; admission remains backed by non-refundable
  allowance charges from validated daemon configuration.
- Reap-driven kanban transitions use `action_intents`. A failed complete/block
  must leave a retryable attempt visible; direct best-effort board writes are
  not an acceptable recovery path.
- Environment sessions (`environments.py`, SF-8): the runtime manifest
  (`.shipfactory/runtime.yaml`) and every script it references are read from
  the trusted base commit by git blob SHA and materialized into a
  Factory-owned scratch root before exec — the candidate workspace is never
  consulted for script bytes, so a candidate that edits or symlinks its own
  bootstrap/app-start script after validation has no effect (finding #32).
  Materialization and app-up both spawn as `start_new_session=True` process
  groups reaped across daemon ticks, mirroring the A1 worker-slot pattern:
  DB row inserted (state `materializing`/`starting`, no pid) *before* Popen,
  pid+OS-start-token attached only after spawn succeeds, so a daemon that
  dies mid-spawn leaves an unambiguous pid-less row.
- A daemon restart never optimistically resumes a mid-flight materialization
  (bootstrap or seed) — it kills the child only if the OS start token still
  matches (never a blind PID kill) and marks it `failed`, forcing a fresh
  content-addressed rebuild on next demand. App sessions are adopted instead
  (state carries over, healthcheck contract re-derived from the pinned
  manifest, never trusted from a stale DB snapshot) because losing a healthy
  app on every daemon bounce would be needlessly disruptive; a token
  mismatch still crashes the row and releases its port lease rather than
  guessing.
- Ports are leased through the same A1 `resource_leases` table (`kind='port'`)
  rather than a parallel table: the specific port number lives in
  `metadata_json`, and the scan-for-a-free-port + insert happens inside the
  same `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` writer transaction that already serializes
  concurrent lease acquisition, so two sessions racing for one port range
  never double-bind.
- Testing adoption-after-restart within one pytest process is not the same
  as a real daemon restart: a genuinely restarted daemon's old children get
  reparented to init, which reaps zombies immediately, but a test that just
  clears an in-memory dict is still the process's real OS parent — a killed
  child sits as a zombie that still answers `ps`/`psutil` identity probes
  with its original (still-matching) start token. Tests simulating this
  must opportunistically `os.waitpid(-1, os.WNOHANG)` in their poll loop,
  or they'll see a supposedly-dead process reported as still alive.
- An exploration reference's `generated` classification was unverified —
  it could relabel any real, hand-authored tracked file (e.g. a test about
  to be deleted) with zero corroboration, since only `existing`/`proposed`
  statuses had required-field or hash checks. `generated` now requires an
  honest `git_blob_sha` whenever its declared path resolves at `base_sha`;
  a path genuinely absent at `base_sha` (a not-yet-built output) still needs
  no corroboration (finding #33, SF-7 adversarial lane).
- `access_mode: readonly` on a v2 recipe step (`explore`, `spec-attack`,
  `plan-attack` in dev-pipeline@5) was validated for shape by the loader but
  never enforced anywhere — every executor (codex, claude, hermes) ran with
  full workspace-write regardless. Prompt wording is not a security
  boundary; the OS is. `shipfactory_spawn` now chmods a readonly step's
  workspace non-writable (dirs `0o550`, files `0o440`) before exec, leaving
  only `.shipfactory-output/` writable so the step can still seal its
  result or emit a verdict (finding #34, SF-7 adversarial lane).

## Conventions

- Git author: `Abhinav Bansal <abhibansal-sg@users.noreply.github.com>`.
  No AI co-author trailers. Public repo — no secrets, tokens, or private
  paths in commits; screenshots/evidence must be scrubbed before adding.
- Findings get numbers (#22–#34 so far). When you fix one: commit message
  cites it, and the lesson lands in this file **in the same run**.
- All tests green before claiming done. `python -m pytest tests/ -q`.
